# Youtube Clone
I build a YouTube Clone Application from Scratch using React. This project is great for learning React because is covers a lot of concepts that appear often in ReactJS workflow. 

Setup:
- replace [youtube-api-key] in src/App.js with your API-key
- run ```npm i && npm start``` to start the development server

Covered topics:
- project structure
- destructuring
- state management (with hooks)
- passing props
- API calls
