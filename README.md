# youtube_video_player_clone
Using React-JS, Material-UI, and Axios, mimic the behavior of Youtube browser

I build a YouTube Clone Application from Scratch using React. This project was great for learning React because is covers a lot of concepts that appear often in ReactJS workflow:

- project structure
- destructuring
- state management (with hooks)
- passing props
- API calls
